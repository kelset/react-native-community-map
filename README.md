> I always had a hard time keep an eye on the React Native community, and in particular finding the “one place” where it lives - over time, I came to the understanding that basically there’s no such single place 😅 but that there are instead many scattered communities.
> What I want this page to be is, basically, **a map of all the different places where React Native developers can be found**. Aside GitHub - I feel that one is pretty much a given 😅

> _I don’t necessarily use all these resources myself, but I wanted to collect as many as I could find - I based it on my personal experience + some links from around the web. But it’s by all means a fluid document: I really hope you all can [help me expand it](/CONTRIBUTING.md) to be more comprehensive. Special shoutout to Jérôme Abel for his help in adding more resources to this list!_
